The github classroom interface won't let me annotate your blog post, so I'm recording my feedback notes here.

* I appreciate the visualization of all the different image categories.
* Why do you think the loss/accuracy bounce around so much on the validation set even before reaching the range (epoch 12+) where you're declaring it to be over-fit?
* Horizontal/vertical flips don't seem like an appropriate augmentation for this data set. Don't many of the signs depend on orientation?
    - I see you explained this subsequently.
* Your test of generalization on another data set was well done, and the result makes sense. What would you do about it if you wanted to build a more-robust model?
* Very good writing and visualizations overall.
